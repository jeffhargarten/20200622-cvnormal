        <p>As COVID-19 lockdowns gradually roll back and the aftermath of civil unrest somewhat settles down, Minnesotans are seemingly socially distancing less and are more engaged with summertime activities.</p>

        <p>Yet with many summer events canceled for the year and several restrictions still in place, normalcy seems far off, and may not fully return anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Data from various sources reveal some ways Minnesotans have started returning to normal routines â€“ and other ways that life remains altered.</p>

        <p>As new data are obtained, this page may be updated.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Vehicular traffic has roared back</h2>

        <p>After weeks of climbing back toward normal levels, Minnesota's roadways are closer to typical activity levels.</p>

        <p>Despite traffic density falling significantly since shelter-in-place orders took effect statewide, Minnesota Department of Transportation daily tracking shows the volume of vehicles now looks more like last year at this time.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Social distancing breaks down</h2>
        <p>On the whole, Minnesotans are back to typical isolation levels <a href="https://www.startribune.com/how-minnesotans-are-lightening-up-on-social-distancing/568966921/">after slacking off for a while</a>. Unacast data measuring social distancing <a href="https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard?view=state&fips=27" target="new_">shows Minnesota's grade</a> had been sliding gradually from a B when shelter-in-place started in March and by May was scoring an F, like much of the United States.</p>

        <p>And Google data shows where they're going: mostly to parks and other recreation areas to take advantage of Minnesota's limited summer weather.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Buses and trains remain emptier</h2>

        <p>Even though transit routes have started opening back up, safety restrictions and service reductions remain across the Twin Cities metro area. That, combined with continued work-from-home arrangements, seem to still be depressing ridership on buses and light rail.</p>

        <p>Ridership ceased completely as Metro Transit shut down over the period of unrest and mandatory curfews enforced immediately after the death of George Floyd, but have bounced back.</p>

        <p>Bars and restaurants may be missing typical crowds for a while, even with the reopening of indoor and outdoor dining. Concerns over safety, restrictions on restaurant crowd capacity, diner spacing and required reservations may be keeping many would-be patrons away.</p>

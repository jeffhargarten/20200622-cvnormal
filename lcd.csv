        <p>As COVID-19 lockdowns gradually roll back and the aftermath of civil unrest somewhat settles down, Minnesotans are seemingly socially distancing less and are more engaged with summertime activities.</p>

        <p>Yet with many summer events canceled for the year and several restrictions still in place, normalcy seems far off, and may not fully return.</p>

        <p>Data from various sources reveal some ways Minnesotans have started returning to normal routines â€“ and other ways that life remains altered.</p>

        <p>As new data is obtained, this page may be updated.</p>

        <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Vehicular traffic has roared back</h2>

        <p>After weeks of climbing back toward normal levels, Minnesota's roadways are closer to typical activity levels.</p>

        <p>Despite traffic density falling significantly since shelter-in-place orders took effect statewide, Minnesota Department of Transportation daily tracking shows the volume of vehicles now looks more like last year at this time.</p>

        <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Buses and trains remain emptier</h2>

        <p>Even though transit routes have started opening back up, safety restrictions and service reductions remain across the Twin Cities metro area. That, combined with continued work-from-home arrangements, seem to still be depressing ridership on buses and light rail.</p>

        <p>Ridership ceased completely as Metro Transit shut down over the period of unrest and mandatory curfews enforced immediately after the death of George Floyd, but have bounced back.</p>

        <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Restaurant diners are returning, slowly</h2>
        <p>Bars and restaurants will still be missing crowds for awhile too, since even with the reopening of indoor and outdoor dining, restrictions on capacity, diner spacing and required reservations seem have kept many patrons eating at home, getting takeout or ordering delivery.</p>

        <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Social distancing breaks down</h2>
        <p>On the whole, Minnesotans are back to typical isolation levels as well, according to Unacast data that measures social distancing. Minnesota's grade had been sliding gradually from a B+ when shelter-in-place started in March, reached a D- just before it ended, and now, like much of the United States, sits at an F.</p>

        <p>And Google data shows where they're going: mostly to parks and other outdooor recreation areas to take advantage of Minnesota's limited summer weather.</p>
